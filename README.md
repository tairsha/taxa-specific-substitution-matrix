# taxa-specific-substitution-matrix
Algorithms for the generation of substitution matrices from intra-taxa variation data. Implemented and published on human genetic variation data.

* calculate_ha.py: This module can be used to construct an amino-acid substitution matrix from codon substitution matrix which is taken to the specified power.
* deduce_substiution_matrices.py: This module can be used to calculate substitution matrices according to aggregated variant information (this can be done in codon/nucleotide/AA reolsution).
* symmtery_analysis.py: This module can be used to perform a symmetry analysis on a substitution matrix.
